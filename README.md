# AssetPicker

AssetPicker is a free asset or file picker designed to be easily included into web application interfaces. It has a file abstraction layer allowing adapters to connect to any remote storage, be it cloud storages like Amazon S3, Google Drive or Dropbox or assets from a custom web application server. In opposite to other file managers or pickers, AssetPicker is suitable for hierarchical as well as associative file storages.
